# The Password Dungeon Delver

This project’s main goal is to give the users a fun and engaging game that provides further insight into how various types of password cracking techniques work. We intend on creating a video game to bridge the gap between learning the methods of password cracking, and making it fun and engaging to the students. 

## Description

The player will first be taken through a tutorial level to explain the controls, objectives, and overall goal of the game which is to escape the dungeon. The user finds a gadget that will aid them in cracking the passwords. This device will represent the usage of a program or tool used for cracking passwords (e.g. hashcat) and it will be called the “Password Cracker 9000”. In this project we will cover brute force method of password cracking. Through the use of their gadget they will learn how to do brute force manually, then learn about hashcat and how it makes brute force easier and faster.
